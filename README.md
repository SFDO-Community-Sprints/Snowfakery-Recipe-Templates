> [Snowfakery](https://snowfakery.readthedocs.io/en/docs/) Recipe Templates repository showcases all contributed Snowfakery recipes by volunteers from numerous SFDC Community Sprints. All the recipes are under the [BSD 3-Clause License](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Snowfakery-Recipe-Templates/blob/main/LICENSE) and are maintained by [Data Gen Toolkit](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/DataGenerationToolkit) team.


## Snowfakery Use Cases
1. You can use Snowfakery to seed synthetic data into a sandbox or a scratch org.
2. You can generate synthetic data for standard objects, custom objects and custom objects for managed packages.
3. You can generate synthetic data and output as SQL or CSV file or load directly to a target Salesforce org using CCI.
4. Snowfakery also supports seeding files as [ContentVersions](https://snowfakery.readthedocs.io/en/docs/salesforce.html#contentversions) using standard plugins.
5. You can [query](https://snowfakery.readthedocs.io/en/docs/salesforce.html#incorporating-information-from-salesforce) existing Salesforce data and relate to snowfakery recipe.
6. The usage of Snowfakery is not limited to NPSP nor EDA; however, Data Gen Toolkit team develops resources to advocate nonprofits and education community.

## Development
Multiple steps are required to set up a development-ready environment in your local machine. After completing the initial setup, the snowfakery recipes in the repository can be utilized for loading data to a scratch org.

  - Clone this repository into your local directory 

  ``` cli
  $ git clone https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Snowfakery-Recipe-Templates.git
  ```
  - [Set up CumulusCI](https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started.html) : this repository includes a project initialization in cumulusci.yml file. You can skip the project initialization `cci project init` 

  ### Create a Scratch Org and Load Data

  Choose NPSP or EDA CCI flow (not both!):

    To create an EDA-based scratch org from this repo:

  1. Run `cci flow run eda:trial_org --org dev` to deploy this project.
  2. Run `cci task run generate_and_load_from_yaml -o generator_yaml snowfakery_samples/EDA/eda_objects.yml --org dev` to load example data.
  3. Run `cci org browser dev` to open the org in your browser.

    To create an NPSP-based scratch org from this repo:

  1. Run `cci flow run npsp:install_prod --org dev` to deploy this project.
  2. Run `cci task run generate_and_load_from_yaml -o generator_yaml <INSERT YOUR YAML FILE NAME HERE> --org dev` to load example data.  For example, the YML file might be snowfakery_samples/npsp/Account_Soft_Credit_npsp.recipe.yml
  3. Run `cci org browser dev` to open the org in your browser.
