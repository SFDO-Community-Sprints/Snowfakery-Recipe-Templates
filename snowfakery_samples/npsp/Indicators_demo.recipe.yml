# And then creates Opportunities (5-10) spanning 5 years, their associated soft credits (partial and account).
# It also creates a single Campaign record 
# The Campaign has two Campaign Statuses added, one IsResponded = true and one IsResponded = false 
# The selected number (?) of Contacts are added and NPSP will auto-create the associated Household Account.
